/**
 *
 * @brief Initiate a cooperative context switch
 *
 * The z_arch_swap() routine is invoked by various kernel services to effect
 * a cooperative context context switch.  Prior to invoking z_arch_swap(), the caller
 * disables interrupts via irq_lock() and the return 'key' is passed as a
 * parameter to z_arch_swap().  The 'key' actually represents the BASEPRI register
 * prior to disabling interrupts via the BASEPRI mechanism.
 *
 * z_arch_swap() itself does not do much.
 *
 * It simply stores the intlock key (the BASEPRI value) parameter into
 * current->basepri, and then triggers a PendSV exception, which does
 * the heavy lifting of context switching.

 * This is the only place we have to save BASEPRI since the other paths to
 * z_arm_pendsv all come from handling an interrupt, which means we know the
 * interrupts were not locked: in that case the BASEPRI value is 0.
 *
 * Given that z_arch_swap() is called to effect a cooperative context switch,
 * only the caller-saved integer registers need to be saved in the thread of the
 * outgoing thread. This is all performed by the hardware, which stores it in
 * its exception stack frame, created when handling the z_arm_pendsv exception.
 *
 * On ARMv6-M, the intlock key is represented by the PRIMASK register,
 * as BASEPRI is not available.
 *
 * @return -EAGAIN, or a return value set by a call to
 * z_arch_thread_return_value_set()
 *
